      <p>
      Hello World! I'm a human being from Mexico City. I studied Architecture at Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México (UNAM) and then Project Management at UNAM as well. I'm experienced in Construction & Real Estate Development 
        (all its phases), eager to apply my knowledge on a modern work environment 
        and continue my personal and professional growth in the process. I'm currently
        learning how to code in a Bootcamp! This page was made by me!
